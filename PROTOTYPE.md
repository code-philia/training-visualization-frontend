# Training Dynamic Visualization
Training Dynamic Visualization, a technique designed to visualize high-dimensional representations during the deep learning training process. In other words, our method is designed to transform the model training dynamics into an animation of canvas with colorful dots and territories.

# How to Use it?

## Pull Our Code
We strongly recommend that you store source code and training dynamics in the **Linux file system** instead of the Windows file system to get a complete user experience.
```
git clone https://github.com/code-philia/time-travelling-visualizer.git
```

The project structure looks as follow:
```
time-travelling-visualizer
│   README.md
|
└───training_dynamic
│   │   README.md
    
│   
└───Vis
|   │   singleVis | ...
|   │   trustvis  | ...
|   │   subject_model_eval.py
|   │   trustvis_tempo.py 
|   │   requirements.txt
|   
│   
└───VisTool
│   │   Backend
│   |   |    ...
│   |   |    server

```

- training_dynamic fold is for storing the dataset
- Vis fold is for training the visualization models
- visTool fold is the interactive visualization tool's backend and frontend

⚠️ Note that, the training_dynamic folder stores the training process and the target dataset. 

# Environment Configuration
1. create conda environment
```
$ conda create -n visualizer python=3.7
$ (visualizer) ~/time-travelling-visualizer$ conda activate visualizer
```

2. install pyTorch and CUDA
For setting up PyTorch on that conda environment, use the guidelines provided at [PyTorch's official local installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). This guide will help you select the appropriate configuration based on your operating system, package manager, Python version, and CUDA version.

3. install requirements

For linux developers, you can use the following command to install the required packages.
```
$ (visualizer) ~/time-travelling-visualizer$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For windows developers, you can use the following command instead.
```
$ (visualizer) ~/time-travelling-visualizer$ pip install -r win-requirements.txt
```

Note that, if you are using VPN or other proxy, please specify `--proxy` parameter to install the packages.

4. vector database environment configuration
If you wish to explore the vector database extension on our visualization tool, please follow the steps below to install the necessary packages.

Please note that the **versions** of Docker and Docker Compose are important! You can refer to the official documentation, [Milvus's Prerequisties](https://milvus.io/docs/prerequisite-docker.md), or simply follow the commands provided below.

For linux developers, you can use the following command to install Docker and Docker Compose.
```
$ (visualizer) ~/time-travelling-visualizer$ pip install docker==6.1.3
$ (visualizer) ~/time-travelling-visualizer$ pip install docker-compose==1.29.2
```

For windows developers, Windows with WSL 2 enabled and Docker Desktop are needed.

For installing Linux on Windows with WSL, use the guidelines provided at [Microsofts's official WSL installation page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) 

When your WSL is ready, you should move both your **source code** and **training dynamics** into WSL file system.

For setting up WSL 2 with Docker Desktop, see [WSL](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/).

And if you want to open your WSL distribution in VS Code, refer to the documentation at [Microsofts's official WSL tutorial for vscode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode) 

After completing the above steps, you should install Docker Compose by:
```
$ (visualizer) ~/time-travelling-visualizer$ pip install docker-compose==1.29.2
```

## Training Process Dataset (the training process of a model)


You can train your classification model and save the training dynamics. For information on the structure of the training dynamics directory and the config file format, refer to the the [dataset's readme document](./training_dynamic/README.md). For details about training visualization model on training dynamics, refer to the [Vis Model's readme document](./Vis/README.md)

🍃 Training dynamics examples are also available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/code-philia/mtpnet) for you to download. 

1. download training dynamics example from huggingface
```
~/time-travelling-visualizer$ cd training_dynamic
~/time-travelling-visualizer/training_dynamic$ git lfs clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/code-philia/mtpnet.git
~/time-travelling-visualizer/training_dynamic$ unzip mtpnet/case_study_mnist_backdoor.zip
```
2. unzip the dataset file

For linux user, you can unzip the example dataset into training_dynamic directory using the command
```
~/time-travelling-visualizer/training_dynamic$ unzip mtpnet/case_study_mnist_backdoor.zip
```
For windows user, you can unzip the example dataset into training_dynamic directory using the command
```
~/time-travelling-visualizer/training_dynamic$ Expand-Archive mtpnet/case_study_mnist_backdoor.zip -DestinationPath .
```

With this provided example, you can directly experience our tool.

If you want to train your own visualization model, refer to the the [visualization model's readme document](./Vis/README.md).

# Run interactive Visualizer Tool
```
~/time-travelling-visualizer$ cd /Tool/server
~/time-travelling-visualizer/Tool/server$ conda activate visualizer
```
For linux and WSL users, you can use this command to start the tool with vector database (It will take a few minutes to start the docker container in the first time)
```
~/time-travelling-visualizer/Tool/server$ (visualizer) ./start_server.sh 
```
Windows users can use the following command instead to run the tool
```
~/time-travelling-visualizer/Tool/server$ (visualizer) python server.py
```
you will see: 
```
